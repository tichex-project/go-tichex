# Tichex Blockchain

Tichex is a DPoS blockchain based on Tendermint and Cosmos SDK.

Tichex was created to solve the problem of centralized stable coins. It also solves the problem of liquidity, be they Crypto/crypto or Crypto/fiat. On the Tichex blockchain it will be possible to create 3 different types of tokens.

## Blockchain
The blockchain is based on the Bizantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm (consent 2/3 of the network), with DPoS Stacking algorithm.

## Types of Token
* Token pegged to Fiat
* Liquidity Token pegged to THX (our native coin)
* Standard Token (no pegged)

## Main Actors
To make the blockchain work, there must be 4 types of users.

* Fiat Providers
* Validators
* Companies
* Users

The *Fiat Providers*, are authorized and regulated banking institutions. Their job is to act as a bridge between our blockchain and their banking circuit. They are the only ones authorized to issue (mint) part of a Fiat Token. Let's say part, because in the Tickex blockchain the pegged to fiat tokens start with T, for example THEUR, THUSD, THGBP, THKRW.
A Fiat Provider can then make a mint of the following tokens. Let's take an example ...

*EMoney* being an authorized institution, applies to be a Tichex Fiat Provider. To apply, Emoney will open a proposal on the Tichex blockchain, after which the proposal will have a voting period of 30 days (or more). Validators and any other users who have placed THX in Stacking have the right to express an opinion and then vote on the proposal. The user's rating will have the weight relative to its value in the network (eg if there are 100 million THX in Stacking and the user John put in stacking 1000, his vote will have a voting power of 0.0001%)
During the voting period, anyone can execute and / or request documentation certifying the solidity of the Fiat Provider. Once the voting period is over, the Fiat Provider will be authorized to issue the Fiat Token on our blockchain. Another example is SisalPay which decides to issue its own token linked to the Euro and can pegged it to THEUR simply by selecting a box. In that case any sisal pay transaction would run on Tickex's Blockchain.
In order to avoid frauds or non-solid providers, the Fiat Provider, in addition to passing the voting process, will also have to deposit the equivalent of € 1,000,000 in THX to the other Fiat Providers. These days we have witnessed the Tether scandal, where it would seem that there was a shortfall of 850 million dollars from the bitfinex cash desks. Such episodes make a sector with a huge growth potential lose credibility. With this system, the risk is reduced to the minimum terms as it will no longer be just an entity to issue THEUR, but a group of institutions will issue a single token linked to the Euro. The same is valid for any other Fiat Token.

In summary, the Fiat Providers will be the THEUR Miners and other stable tokens and must comply with legislative and community requirements.

## The Validators
They have a very important role, they are responsible for our blockchain. In order to be as decentralized as possible, in an initial phase Tichex will have 100 validators, then the number will be extended to 500. The Validators have the role of proposing the blocks with the transactions, they are chosen based on their voting power (ie the number of THX in Stacking / the total of THX in Stacking). The block creation time will be about 5 seconds, with each new block created [X] THX, this reward will be sent every 12 blocks (about one minute) and will be divided to all the Validators, based on their voting power.
The Validators will also gain from the transaction fee (also decided by proposal). Every 250,000 blocks (about 2 weeks) the number of THX issued will be decreased, the blocks will finish issuing THX as soon as the supply of 10,000,000,000 THX (to be decided) will be reached. The fees, even if microscopic, will be applied for transfers, token creation, choice of ticker ...

## Companies
"Companies" means the business engine, or anything that transacts. Imagine an e-commerce, on our blockchain can issue a token and decide whether to do it Fiat pegged, liquidity pegged (ie pegged to other liquidty tokens within Tichex, including the native one) or a standard token ie no pegged. Subsequently, through a special plugin, it can accept payments on its site through its token or through other internal Tichex tokens and have immediate Crypto or Fiat liquidity.
In many cases, even Fiat Providers can start offering this new services to their business customers.

Users, on the other hand, can make transactions, create tokens, exchange them on our native Exchange, do IEO in a decentralized manner and also have immediate liquidity.

Another example is another institution that joins the circuit and extends the service to its customers, so the user will generate tokens from his account.

Liquidity tokens, having immediate liquidity, can be exchanged immediately without having to enter the order in Exchange.

## ICO? No, thanks!
Tichex has no intention to carry out any ICO. The engine will be activated from the first block.

In the genesis block, *THX* will have an initial supply of 0 and will be issued as the first reward block. THEUR instead, will be issued by Emoney and will be purchased by the Validator for the initial staking. (We could also propose an initial auction for the first 16, in this case 100 Validator will be reached later in the time).
Once the block 12 is born, the Validators already have the first rewards, and can therefore go to sell them in THEUR determining the market value. THEUR/THX will be the first pair available.

The technologies used are the same as those of Binance, BitSong, Minter, Cosmos, Iris Network. All advanced and interconnected blockchains thanks to Cosmos.

The project would immediately attract a large number of investors (as well as Validator, ultimately fighting for all that is Cosmos) and throwing down the first real decentralized blockchain with stable currencies, Fiat Providers and liquid tokens.
