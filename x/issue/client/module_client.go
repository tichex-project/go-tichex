Users only need to call the standard system interface to issue tokens instead of using solidity or other languages. Given the many security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts, we realize that user-customized smart contracts contain high potential security risks. To reduce risks, user programming for standard functional components should be minimized." +
